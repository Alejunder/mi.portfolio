    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "I started in the world of programming in September 2024. I began with frontend, an intense learning process that lasted until April of this year. I worked on my portfolio until the end of May.\n\nWith my frontend skills solid, I continued my learning and began training in artificial intelligence during the month of June. I learned different tools to automate processes, both no-code like Make, and code-based like n8n. I learned both in a more superficial way, with the goal of understanding how the most modern technology works.\n\nAt the end of June, I began my backend training. July was a month in which I set myself the goal of learning backendâ€”a goal I achieved. Now I am refining and deepening certain topics, but I can already consider myself a fullstack developer ready to solve any kind of problem. Thanks to my ability to adapt to any situation and my quick learning skills, I can take on any challenge.\n\nIf you have a project in mind and want to make it take off, youâ€™ve just found your best option."
